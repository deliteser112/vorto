## Release Notes - 0.10.0 milestone 3

**Fixes and Enhancements**

- EU-GDPR Compliance of Vorto Repository, i.e. Export of user-specific Vorto models.
- Eclipse Hono Generator, supporting the generation of Arduino-, Python- and Java source code.
- Code Generator Configuration UI. Code Generators that are executed from the Eclipse Vorto Toolset do now provide a configuration UI that allows developers to customize the execution of the generator.


**API Changes**
 
- Vorto Code Generators must now implement `org.eclipse.vorto.codegen.api.IVortoCodeGenerator.getInfo()` that give more meta information about the specific Code Generator. This information is used by Vorto to provide a Generator Configuration UI automatically.
- The Vorto Repository REST - API for publishing models is now secured exclusively with OAuth2 token - based authentication. 
	> It is now only possibly to publish models to the Vorto Repository via the Vorto Repository Web UI !
