## Overview

By means of code generators, you can create information model based code artifacts which you can use in specific solutions. There are the following options to get an appropriate code generator:

* Using Example Code Generators  
  Along with the Vorto Toolset, several code generators are installed (refer to [Vorto Code Generators](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/server/generators/Readme.md)).
* Implementing Own Code Generators  
  Vorto provides wizards to implement your own code generator (refer to [Implementing a Code Generator]({{base}}/documentation/developer-api/codegenerator-implementation.html)).  
  The following examples explain the concept of implementing own code generators:  
  * [Example 1 - Web Device Application Code Generator]({{base}}/documentation/code-generators/webdevice-codegenerator.html)  
  * [Example 2 - Bosch M2M Platform Code Generator]({{base}}/documentation/code-generators/m2m-codegenerator.html)
