We are happy to announce Eclipse Vorto 0.10 Milestone 2. It is available on <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/vorto" target="_blank">Github</a>.<br>
One of the major highlights is the definition and execution of device mapping specifications using a lightweight mapping library. This allows the integration of devices whose device firmware cannot be changed.
