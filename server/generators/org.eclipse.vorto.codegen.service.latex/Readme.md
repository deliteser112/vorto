# Latex Code Generator

Generates the characteristics and services of a device in the LaTeX format which then can be exported into many other outputs.


# Build & Run

	mvn clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local

**That's it**. When the generator starts up, it automatically registers itself at the Vorto Repository and is ready to be used.
