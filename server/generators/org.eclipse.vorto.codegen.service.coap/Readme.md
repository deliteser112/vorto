# CoAP Code Generator

This generator creates a CoAP client and server, based on Eclipse Californium, that is able to exchange CoAP messages based on information models.

# Build & Run

	mvn clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local

**That's it**. When the generator starts up, it automatically registers itself at the Vorto Repository and is ready to be used.
