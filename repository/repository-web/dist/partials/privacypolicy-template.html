		<hr>

		<h2>About this document</h2>
		<p>This document covers protection and privacy topics for personal
			data related to the Eclipse Vorto repository - hereinafter referred
			to as &quot;Vorto&quot;. It discusses how Vorto collects and
			processes personal data.</p>
		<p>
			This policy is an addendum to the <a
				href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/privacy.php"
				class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Foundation Privacy
				Policy</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Key Points</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Information models marked public are visible by anyone. You
				cannot unpublish a released and public model, you can only deprecate
				it since others might already be referring to your model.</li>
			<li>You have full control on inviting collaborators to your
				namespace and privileges for each of them.</li>
			<li>We only store your GitHub-Id (for GitHub authentication) or
				Bosch Subject-Id (for Bosch.IO authentication) to uniquely identify
				you. Email-id is optional and you can choose to add/remove it from
				your account.</li>
			<li>You can export all your models and choose to delete your
				account at anytime. All published models for a deleted account
				becomes anonymous.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Types of personal data collected and processed</h2>
		<p>The following personal data is processed:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Account Information:
				<ul>
					<li>
						GitHub-Id: The GitHub-Id is an identifier which uniquely
						identifies your account if you login with your GitHub credentials.
						Models created or modified by you show this identifier publicly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bosch Subject-Id and Suite Auth: The Bosch.IO Subject-Id is an identifier
						which uniquely identifies your account if you login with your
						Bosch.IO credentials. Models created or modified by you show this
						identifier publicly.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				IP address: Captured in access logs, used to serve you data
				faster using CDN.
			</li>
			<li>
				E-mail address (Optional): A user may provide an email
				address. Email address is used by the system to notify users of
				pending actions such as release approvals or notify the user upon
				discussions on their models.
			</li>
			<li>
				Users' OAuth2 identifiers (and optionally, e-mail addresses) are persisted upon signing up
				to the Vorto service.
			</li>
			<li>
				They are deleted from Vorto data stores, and their references anonymized, when a user
				deletes their account.
			</li>
			<li>
				The anonymization process impacts on references to user identifiers in:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Model authorship (the "author" property of a model)
					</li>
					<li>
						Model authorship for last modification (the "lastModifiedBy" property of a model)
					</li>
					<li>
						Comment authorship (the "author" property of a comment on a model). <br/>
						<b>Important:</b> comment content is not anonymized.
						<br/>Comments can be deleted by their
						author if they have not been anonymized, or by the Vorto user(s) managing the
						namespace(s) hosting the Vorto models for which comments have been written.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Note</b>: Deleting a user's account requires the user to relinquish any exclusive
				administrative privileges they have on any number of Vorto namespaces, to another user
				of their choice.
				If there is any difficulty, the Vorto team can be contacted directly for assistance.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Other information you share with us</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Public Information: You are solely responsible for Vorto
				models created or modified by you. Think carefully before sharing or
				releasing a model and marking them public, especially if they
				contain sensitive information. Your account identifier and
				timestamps for your models are visible to other users of Vorto
				repository depending on who you share your namespaces/models with.
			</li>
			<li>
				Comments: Any comment made by you as part of discussions on
				a Vorto model are visible to all collaborators of your namespace. A
				copy of your comment will also be sent to your email if you have
				have provided your email address in your account settings. You are
				solely responsible for the content of your comments.
			</li>
			<li>
				Images: You are solely responsible for images uploaded by
				you. Please make sure the images do not infringe any copyright.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Visibility of user information</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				User identifiers are either visible Vorto only, to other Vorto users, or to the public at
				large, depending on the case.
				<ul>
					<li>
						The visibility of OAuth2 identifiers contextually to model authorship
						(the "author" and "lastModifiedBy" properties) depends on the model's visibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						Public models are visible to the general public.
					</li>
					<li>
						Other models are visible to authenticated Vorto users who are collaborators on the
						namespaces where those models reside.
					</li>
					<li>
						All models are visible to system administrators - i.e. for vorto.eclipseprojects.io, the Vorto
						development team.
					</li>
					<li>
						The visibility of comments on a model depends on the model's visibility, as above.
					</li>
					<li>
						Additionally, some Vorto features (e.g. requesting or providing access to a namespace)
						allow authenticated Vorto users to search for other users by a partial match of the
						desired OAuth2 identifier, without restrictions.<br/>
						In some cases, e.g. when a user manages the collaborators for a Vorto namespace they
						manage, the collaborators' identifier and the OAuth2 provider associated with that
						identifier will be visible to the user.<br/>
						The collaborators' e-mail addresses are <i>never</i> visible to other users, with the
						exception of system administrators.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				E-mail addresses are kept private at all time, and are only visible to the Vorto system
				administrators - i.e. for vorto.eclipseprojects.io, the Vorto development team. <br/>
				Setting one's e-mail address is entirely optional, and the e-mail address can be deleted
				or modified at any time without deleting one's account.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br />
		</p>
