# Model comments

To further collaboration, Vorto allows users to comment on models. 

A comment is a plain text message bearing the author's name and date/time of creation (server time).

## Who can write comments?

Any authenticated Vorto user can write comments on models, with a few conditions. 

 
- Either the model is public, or
- The commenting user is a collaborator in the namespace where the model they intend to comment on
is located

## Comments and user privacy

There are a few useful notions to be aware of, regarding comments.

- The comment author's name is displayed above the comment
- If a user deletes their account, all their comments are anonymized, i.e. the author becomes 
*anonymous*
- If a user is no longer a collaborator on a namespace, all the comments they have written for 
models in that namespace are anonymized as above
- As the anonymization only concerns authorship, it is *strongly* recommended not to add personal 
information in comment bodies 
- Every user can delete their own comments as long as they haven't been anonymized
- Users who manage a namespace can delete every comment in that namespace regardless of authorship

## Scope and moderation

- Comments are intended as a means to exchange information on models
- They should not contain any personal data, offensive statements or anything violating the 
[Terms of Service](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/termsofuse.php)
- Namespace administrators are encouraged and expected to provide moderation on comments in the 
namespaces they manage
