# Integrating AWS Kinesis with Eclipse Vorto for IoT anomaly detection

In this tutorial, you are going to learn, how you can use Eclipse Vorto to send harmonized device telemetry data to AWS Kinesis.

> **What is AWS Kinesis?** 

> With AWS Kinesis, you can collect and process large amount of data in real time, for example to do anomaly detection or other cool stuff.

If you are now asking yourself, what role Eclipse Vorto plays in using Kinesis, the answer is simple: Eclipse Vorto harmonizes the connected device data before sending it to AWS Kinesis, so that data analytics  can work with the same data format, regardless of how the device/sensors sends the data. 

In short, Eclipse Vorto makes it very easy to integrate with AWS Kinesis, thanks to the already available [Vorto AWS Kinesis plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/blob/master/vorto-middleware/middleware-ext-kinesis/Readme.md). It basically transforms your IoT device data to a normalized, semantic format (e.g. from binary to JSON) and then send it to AWS Kinesis for further processing.

## Prerequisites

* Read the introduction on the [Eclipse Vorto middleware service](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/blob/master/vorto-middleware/Readme.md)
* Set up the Eclipse Vorto normalization middleware and created payload mapping specifications for your connected sensors. Please follow the [mapping pipeline tutorial](create_mapping_pipeline.md) for details.
* AWS account for using the Kinesis service

Ready? Cool, let's get started.

## Steps

Here are the steps, that we are going to take during this tutorial:

1. Setting up Kinesis on AWS
2. Configuring and starting the Vorto middleware with your AWS Kinesis data stream settings
3. Sending device data to Eclipse Hono via MQTT and monitor the incoming data in the Eclipse Vorto middleware dashboard
4. Verifying the normalized device payload in AWS Kinesis

<br />

## Step 1: Setting up AWS Kinesis

1. Log on to AWS Management Console 
2. Open the AWS Kinesis Dashboard
3. Click **Create Data Stream**
4. Specify a stream name, e.g. *vortoDemo*
5. Specify number of shards. Let's start with **1** for the time being. This number highly depends on the amount of data you are going to process in Kinesis.
6. Confirm with **Create Kinesis Stream** 

## Step 2: Configurating & Starting the Eclipse Vorto Middleware

1. Head over to AWS IAM, and create a technical user with AWS Kinesis full access permissions. Keep note of the access key and secret key. 
2. Start the Eclipse Vorto Middleware docker with the required [Kinesis environment variables](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples/blob/master/vorto-middleware/middleware-ext-kinesis/Readme.md#configuration).
3. Once the service has started successfully, open the local [Eclipse Vorto middleware dashboard](http://localhost:8080/#/plugins). You should see the AWS Kinesis plugin in active mode (green light). 

**Congrats!** Your middleware is all set now to receive IoT device data from Eclipse Hono protocol adapters and forward it to your AWS Kinesis stream.

## Step 3: Sending device data

1. As in the [mapping tutorial](create_mapping_pipeline.md), send your device data via MQTT to the Eclipse Hono MQTT adapter
2. Open the [Vorto Middleware Monitoring dashboard](http://localhost:8080/#/monitoring) and observe the logs. You should see something like this:

> **Not seeing any incoming data logs?**

> 1. Have you started the middleware with the correct Eclipse Hono tenant and AMQP settings?
> 2. Have you successfully registered the device(s) in the Eclipse Hono Device Registry?

> Head over to the [mapping tutorial](create_mapping_pipeline.md) to find out more about the right settings. 

## Step 4: Verifying the data in Kinesis

1. Open the Kinesis service dashboard in AWS
2. Click **Create Analytics Application**
3. Specify a name, e.g. *VortoDemoDataAnalytics*
4. Select **SQL** for runtime
5. Confirm with **Create Application**
6. Select **Connect streaming data** and select **Kinesis data stream** as source
7. Choose the data stream, we had created in step 1, e.g. *vortoDemo*
8. Leave the other selections as default.
9. Click **Discover schema**. Make sure you are sending data to the Vorto middleware, so that AWS is able to discover the schema from the data it receives. You should be able to see a table, similar to this:<img src="../images/tutorials/integrate_kinesis/kinesis_discover_schema.png"/>
10. Select **Save and confinue**
11. Choose **Go to SQL Editor** in order to process the incoming device data. You can choose from many templates to get you started easily, e.g. **Anomaly detection**
12. Once you have started the kinesis application, you can define your SQL statements on the incoming Vorto harmonized IoT data.

> Don't forget to keep sending data to AWS Kinesis, in order to discover data for defining your SQL statements, as Kinesis operates on real time data. 

**Congratulations!** You can now easily process Vorto harmonized IoT device data using AWS Kinesis data streams. Checkout the **What's next** section to learn more about Kinesis and the cool use cases it supports .
